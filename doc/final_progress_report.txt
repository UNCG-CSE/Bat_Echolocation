#Final Progress Report November 30th 2018

##Introduction to the project

For future scientific research the UNCG Bat & Mouse Lab records bat calls from over 100 sites across North Carolina, including the UNCG wetlands. This generates hundreds of thousands of recordings which are stored as .wav files. In order to save space and preserve relevant information, these .wav files are processed into Zero Crossing (ZC) form. Each file may contain anywhere from 1 to 50 individual bat calls (pulses), with some containing none and others with many more. A pulse may be used for any number of purpose, ranging from echolocation to mating. The Lab is interested in discovering and categorizing new kinds of pulses, however sorting through all of those files by hand would take years. We have been asked to write an algorithm that can categorize pulses for easy labeling by the Lab.

While a .wav file stores a digitized sound wave, ZC form stores the dominant frequencies of that sound wave. For researchers, this form is advantageous because it allows us to easily see the dominant frequency sweep, or shape, of a given pulse. The shape of the pulse indicates it's purpose, with an echolocation call looking drastically different from a hunting call. ZC form provides a couple of other advantages as well, including saving space and aiding in gathering statistics. 

##Goals:
1.Extraction:
Extract meaningful signal from noise.

2.Clustering:
Categorize the extracted calls into different types using clustering techniques.

3.Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation(zero-crossing files) contains abnormal calls(i.e. social calls, foraging calls).


##Outlined tasks for each team member

###Yang P 

Completed:
1. Generated abnormal training sample for classification from the result of K-Means clustering.
2. Generated normal training sample for classification by using bulk proprocessing utility method.
3. Employed Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees and train:test splitting ratio of 7:3 for abnormal bat calls detection. The same six features that were used previously for clustering yield the ¡°best¡± classification accuracy at 90.32%, after trying different parameters combination.  
4. Graduate paper: Abnormal Bat Echolocation Detection

To-do:
1. Apply other machine-learning methodologies to compare to our preliminary result, such as hierarchical clustering and deep learning techniques for classification.
2. More labeled abnormal samples(i.e. social, foraging and feeding) can aid in machine learning technique.

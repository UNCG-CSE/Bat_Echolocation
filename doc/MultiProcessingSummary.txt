####Multiple zero-crossing files processing via AnabatTools.R Copyright (C) 2013  Peter D. Wilson####
#####################################################################################################

Summary Procedure:
Bat calls recording were converted into zero-crossing forms and the files were saved as .zc
These files were then processed to extract Time (microseconds) and Frequency (kHz) for each zero-crossing in .zc files. 
The result of each .zc extraction was saved as dataframe in .csv format.
Filename was added as first column in the dataframe for reference in future multiprocessesing steps.

###Multiple .csv data reading with Python script###
###################################################

Summary Procedure:
From .csv files produced via R, files were feed in batch with glob.glob() function. This is an initial step to perform more task for data wrangling and statistics 
computing in Python.

Note for statistical analysis found in metadata:
The extraction will not be performed on .zc files. Since zero-crossing files were obtained by converting .wav file via Kaleidoscope by Wildlife Aucoustic, Inc.
Kaleidoscope|Classifier|Settings and Kaleidoscope|Classifier|Statistics should be available to Kaleidoscope Pro users, such that an id.csv file will be
created for users when Auto ID for Bats were run when converting .wav files.
If Kaleidoscope users are not Pro users, Auto ID for Bats control panel will not be available, which means the analysis is proprietary to Wildlife Aucoustic, Inc.
Therefore, for the nature of the data, the parsing for such information will not be performed.

####Multiple zero-crossing files processing with ZCANT tool Copyright (C) 2012-2017 by Myotisoft LLC via bat.py ####
####################################################################################################################

Summary Procedure:
Zero-crossing files were processed from a given folder (datadir), and .csv files were returned to specified output folder (outdir).

Next steps:
1. Processed .csv files that incorporates noise reduction, and other signal statistics computing.
2. Merge all bat data thus allowing one file analysis for baseline normalization

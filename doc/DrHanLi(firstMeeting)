##First Meeting with Dr.Han Li

Prefer to process by a software specifically social call.
Dr.Han Li's GOALS: Reduce work load(100,000 to 10,000)
CSC Department's goal: 95% accurate on predicting the model

no library of noise(a lot of diff pattern of noise)
Several species in same recording so there is going to be many diff variation on the ball calls
There is software out there to help filter out noise but don't want to be dependable.

FIRST: Filter out noise

Biological Questions:
--Do they all produce all social call or same social call? At the same rate? Are there any specific species that are more social than others?
--Social call more often at which time of night? Right before sunset?
--Is there a certain time of the year that social call or more frequent?

There is already frequencies that can analyze certain species.

Analyzing the Data(Zero Crossing Data)
--Look at the frequency of the graph
--The shape and slope(steep) of the graph
--X axis is time, Y axis is the frequency
--One file = one pass
--Need to have at least three complete calls to consider a good file
--The recording is trigger base(at certain frequency it will start/stop the recording)

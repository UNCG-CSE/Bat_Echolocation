##Introduction to the project(2-3 paragraph)

This project aims to categorize and identify bat calls for use in future scientific research. 

These bat calls are recorded from over 100 sites across NC, including the UNCG wetlands. This generates hundreds of thousands of recordings.

##Goals:
1.Extraction:
Extract meaningful signal from noise.

2.Clustering:
Categorize the extracted calls into different types using clustering techniques.

3.Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation(zero-crossing files) contains abnormal calls(i.e. social calls, foraging calls).


##Outlined tasks for each team member

###Yang Peng

Completed:
1. Studied background information about Bat Echolocation calls and raw data;
2. Worked on AnalookW to view zero-crossing files and learned Anabat format 132 rules for hex offset data;
3. Decoded the sample raw data using R package and import to python. 

To-do:
1. Data preprocessing: 
May include generate the readable raw data files from Anabat ZC files(zero-crossing files) and batch import to Python. Deal with noises, outliers. Split or merge data.
2. Bat Echolocation Clustering:
Categorize bat calls into different types using machine learning techniques;
3. Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation contains abnormal calls using machine learning techniques.


###Bety Rostandy
Completed:
1. Research background information about raw data;
2. Research data processing with automated algorithm;
3. Create workflow for tasks requirement.

To-do
1. Perform available R-package and AnalookW data extraction;
2. Comparison of extracted information to make proceeding suggestions;
3. Automate the data extraction procedure or generate best practice procedure.

###Kevin Keomalaythong
Completed:
1. Brainstormed and analyzed all available algorithms for sorting through the data
2. Compared between algorithms based on the time taken to implement
3. Selected a suitable algorithm

To-do: 
1. Determine the x- and y-axes of the data
2. Use a mathematical model based on slope calculation to determine a general direction of a curve
3. Use slope information to sort each curve into normal and abnormal groups

###Hadi Soufi

##Introduction to the project(2-3 paragraph)

This project aims to categorize and identify bat calls for use in future scientific research. 

These bat calls are recorded from over 100 sites across NC, including the UNCG wetlands. This generates hundreds of thousands of recordings.

##Goals:
1.Extraction:
Extract meaningful signal from noise.

2.Clustering:
Categorize the extracted calls into different types using clustering techniques.

3.Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation(zero-crossing files) contains abnormal calls(i.e. social calls, foraging calls).


##Outlined tasks for each team member

###Yang Peng

Completed:
1. Did background study about Bat Echolocation and raw data;
2. Learned AnalookW and Anabat format 132;
3. Decoded the sample raw data using R package and import to python. 

To-do:
1. Data preprocessing: 
May include generate the readable raw data files from Anabat ZC files(zero-crossing files) and batch import to Python. Deal with noises, outliers. Split or merge data.
2. Bat Echolocation Clustering:
Categorize bat calls into different types using machine learning techniques;
3. Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation contains abnormal calls using machine learning techniques.

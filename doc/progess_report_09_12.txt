Bat Echolocation
-Progress Report September 12th 2018

--Introduction to the project(2-3 paragraph)

This project aims to categorize and identify bat calls for use in future scientific research. 

These bat calls are recorded from over 100 sites across NC, including the UNCG wetlands. This generates hundreds of thousands of recordings.

Goals:
1.Extraction:
Extract meaningful signal from noise.

2.Clustering:
Categorize the extracted calls into different types using clustering techniques.

3.Classification:
Classify if a Bat Echolocation(zero-crossing files) contains abnormal calls(i.e. social calls, foraging calls).

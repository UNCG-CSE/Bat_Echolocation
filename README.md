# Bat_Echolocation

## Introduction
This is a Bat Echolocation project that will be written in Python that aims to filtter out and identify the usuability of all the zero crossing file. Each memebers will be responsible for certain tasks ranging from implementing algorithms to sort the data to then find trend and make sense out of that sorted data. As of the wrtting of this Introdution, here is our goals for this project: 
1. Process and Cleaning Up all the given zero crossing data from Dr.Han Li.
2. Cluster the data.
3. Classify the different social calls to answer some biological questions concerns to the location and the frequencies of the bat's communication.
4. Predict the social calls.

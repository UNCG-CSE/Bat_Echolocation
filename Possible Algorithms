Algorithm 1(Unproven)
--Let assume we are interesting on an upward curve graphs since that may resemble a bat echolocation. We maybe able to propose the idea to do a left to right scan through the graph data and compare a pair of nodes(data) to each other. We can look into the x and y coordinates and see where point B is comparing to A. Since we are interesting in the upward motion of the graph point B needs to indicate a positive increment when compare to point A regarding it's x coordinates. Repeat this process until the trend of each pair y's are similar.

Algorithm 2
- Assume a graph of echolocation data has been condensed such that only the dense curves are present and the scattered dots are absent. First, we extrapolate two points A and B such that A is the leftmost endpoint of the curve and B is the rightmost endpoint. Then we calculate the slope of the line that crosses A and B, the slope going in the rightward direction. If the slope of that line is negative, then the curve represents a normal bat call, otherwise it represents an abnormal call. Finally, we sort the respective curves into separate groups based on the slope.
